# Homework: Project Refinement & Consolidation

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> - **Due Date:** [2025-05-06]

---

### Objective:

This week, we will focus on **refining** the work done in Phases 1 and 2 of your mini-project. Instead of introducing new technical components like local models, the goal is to improve the existing Gemini API integration, enhance the user experience, and ensure your project concept is clearly and effectively demonstrated.

---

### Rationale:

Based on recent feedback and considering the upcoming Cloud Exam, we are adjusting the plan for this week. The goal is to:

1.  **Manage Cognitive Load:** Allow you dedicated time to prepare for your cloud exam without adding complex new ML/coding requirements this week.
2.  **Consolidate Learning:** Ensure a strong understanding and implementation of the Gemini API integration (Phase 2), which some groups found challenging.
3.  **Focus on Project Quality:** Provide time to polish your project idea and implementation for the upcoming presentations in Week 8.
4.  **Support:** Offer dedicated time for groups who need assistance to book meetings and resolve specific issues.

Therefore, there is **no Phase 3 involving Hugging Face / local models**. The focus is entirely on improving your existing Phase 1/Phase 2 work.

---

### Need Assistance?

If your group is facing specific challenges with Phase 1 or Phase 2 implementation or needs guidance on refining your project, please **send me an email** to schedule a brief meeting this week. We can work through the issues together.

This focused refinement period should help ensure everyone has a solid, working project foundation ready for the final push towards the Week 8 presentations.

### Task

This week, focus on **improving your existing Phase 2 system** that uses the Gemini API. Choose areas that need the most work for your specific project.

**Possible Areas for Improvement (Choose as needed):**

*   **Improve Gemini Interaction:**
    *   Make your prompt clearer or more specific. Try small wording changes.
    *   Adjust API settings (`temperature`, `max_output_tokens`, etc.) for better results.
    *   Check if the JSON output format is reliable. Improve the prompt or schema if needed.
    *   Add basic error handling (`try...except`) for API calls.

*   **Improve Gradio Interface (UI/UX):**
    *   Make labels, instructions, and outputs easy to understand.
    *   Use the best Gradio input types (Textbox, Dropdown, etc.) for your app.
    *   Format the Gemini output nicely for the user (e.g., use Markdown).
    <!-- *   Optional: Add `examples=[...]` to your `gr.Interface` for easy testing. -->

*   **Improve Code Quality:**
    *   Add comments to explain important parts of your code.
    *   Make sure variable names are clear and the code is organized.

*   **Check Project Goal:**
    *   Does your app now clearly show the main idea from Phase 1?

**Deliverable:**

*   Update your project's Colab notebook in your shared Google Drive folder.
