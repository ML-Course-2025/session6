> [!NOTE]  
> - [How to share Your Colab Notebook](./material/colab.md)
> - [Zoom Recordings](https://metropoliafi-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/samiben_metropolia_fi/EuSPkRmWcYpGsXdjFhE2k80BaZBR-EeccL7AHlnTQya-6w)


> [!IMPORTANT]
>   - The project grade will be based on deliverables from Phase 1 and Phase 2 ONLY ~~ Phase 3~~ (total of 260 points).  
>   - The group presentations in Week 8 (Tuesday, May 6, 2025) will be worth an additional 100 points.
> - There is **no exam** in the Machine Learning part of the course.  
> - The **attendance list** was uploaded by **Erik** and pertains to the **Cloud** part of the course.


> [!NOTE]  
> - In week 8, there will be an individual assignment where you will complete a peer assessment for your group members.
